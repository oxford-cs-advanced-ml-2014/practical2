# What next?

Implement image compression by SVD as described in homework sheet 2.  There is some code in compress.py to start you out.

The first thing you need to do is go find an image you want to compress.  Try not to pick a really big one (~500x500 is good) or it will be slow.

How much can you compress the image without losing quality?
